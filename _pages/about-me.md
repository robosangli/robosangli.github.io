Hi, I'm Ananda! I'm passionate about Robotics & Rowing!

I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign majoring in Mechanical Engineering in May 2023. I then spent about 2 years helping build electric vehicles at the Human Interactive Driving Division in Toyota Research Institute. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Robotics at Northeastern University! 

It's my dream to work on humanoid robots, prosthetics, and assistive robots. This website hosts all my past experiences (professional & projects) in robotics and rowing.
