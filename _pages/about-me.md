Hi, I'm Ananda! I'm passionate about Robotics & Rowing!

I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign majoring in Mechanical Engineering in May 2023. Since then, I have been helping build electric vehicles at the Human Interactive Driving Division in Toyota Research Institute. 

It's my dream to work on humanoid robots, prosthetics, and assistive robots. This website hosts all my past experiences (professional & projects) in robotics and rowing.
