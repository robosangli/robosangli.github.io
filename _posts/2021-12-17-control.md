Location: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA

During my undergraduate time at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I was mentored by Assistant Professor Joao Ramos. He guided me to better understand the principles of Robotic Control and his HOPPY Projectâ€‹ (depicted kangaroo-like motion). This experience introduced me to the realm of bio-inspired robotics and PID (Proportional-Integrative-Derivative) Control.
