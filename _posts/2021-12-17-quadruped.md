excerpt: Designed & developed a quadruped using gear-cam and rigid linkage legs

Timeline: August 2021 - December 2021<br>
Location: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA

For the Mechanical Design I (ME 370) course at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my teammates and I built a quadruped using gear-cam and rigid linkage systems. The horse gait straight trot maneuver inspired our robot design and the quadruped made a timed attempt to cross a 10 m x 1.5 m course.

We followed an iterative design & development process by testing the rigid legs, gear-cam legs individually, and finally all 4 legs together as seen in the videos below.

I worked on the cam-leg design, and the kinematic & force analyses of the rigid link leg (as seen in the [Final Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MsBH1_t7hgvBfjRdC-klt5KrwkJeB4Gf/view?usp=sharing)).
