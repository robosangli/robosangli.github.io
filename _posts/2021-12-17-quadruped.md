Timeline: August 2021 - December 2021<br>
Location: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my peers and I decided to develop an innovative quadruped using gear-cam and rigid linkage systems. 
I worked on the cam-leg design, and the kinematic & force analyses of the rigid link leg

The horse gait straight trot maneuver inspired our robot design and the quadruped made a timed attempt to cross a 10 m x 1.5 m course.
