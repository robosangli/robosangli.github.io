At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my group and I took up the challenge of creating a transmission with two forward speeds, one reverse speed, and a neutral. Additionally, it had to support a 4 kg weight.

Our design utilized spur gears (forward speeds), a v-belt & pulley system (reverse speed), and dog clutch shifters to engage the desired speed. A pair of bevel gears transmitted power to the output shaft.
