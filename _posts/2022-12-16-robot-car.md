Timeline: August 2022 - December 2022<br>
Location: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA

For the Computer Control of Mechanical Systems (ME 461) course at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my group and I built a robot-car with line following & obstacle avoidance capabilities.

I worked on the proportional control to establish two-line following capabilities simulating road boundaries. In addition to supporting my team members, I designed the testing courses seen in the above videos. My teammates worked on the Raspberry Pi-to-TI Launchpad communication protocol (UART), one-line following, and crash detection.
