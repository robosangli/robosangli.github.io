Timeline: January 2023 - May 2023<br>
Location: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my partner and I worked on a UR3 Robot with ROS (Robot Operating System), OpenCV (Computer Vision), and Forward & Inverse Kinematics. Two leaning towers of lire are used to build a bridge. My partner and I placed 3rd overall for building the second tallest bridge (9 layers) with the largest bridge span (28.3 cm). Use the link above to view the image of the final demo.
