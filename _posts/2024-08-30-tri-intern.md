Timeline: December 2023 - August 2024<br>
Location: Los Altos, CA, USA

I was an intern on the Platform Research team in Human Interactive Driving at Toyota Research Institute

I assisted in the development of a new battery electric vehicle. I developed and integrated low-level systems by writing low-level control software on Matlab & Simulink, interfacing necessary electronics through CAN Bus communication, designing hardware housings through Solidworks (3D CAD), and designing necessary high-level communication to specific electronics through ROS2 (Robot Operating System) & Python.

I developed a brake-by-wire system, human-machine interface keypad & displays, a motion-sim handbrake, and a mechanical housing for on-board computers. 

I also assisted in managing a University collaboration project, developing an independent steering system, and designing and procuring parts for this project.
