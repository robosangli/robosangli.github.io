Hullbot is a robotics startup based in Sydney, Australia with a mission of decarbonizing the global maritime industry by addressing three areas: carbon emissions, microplastics & toxic paints, biosecurity.

I support biweekly cleans of the SF Bay Ferries to reduce the biofouling on the hulls, thereby saving fuel and reducing emissions.

The ferry structure consists of 2 keels and for each clean two operations work on opposite sides of the hull (port & starboard) effectively.

To clean the sections between the midship and the stern (including the fins) the robot is operated at a different location.

The setup usually involves the hullbot robot, the tether spool, an underwater pressure tester, and a computer that relays the camera & positioning data to the operator. The robots have depth, cruise, and hull-hold control capabilities which simplify the teleoperation process. This is particularly important in challenging conditions with vortices and reduced depth visibility
