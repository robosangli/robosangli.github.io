</figure>

To clean the sections between the midship and the stern (including the fins) the robot is operated at a different location.

The setup usually involves the hullbot robot, the tether spool, an underwater pressure tester, and a computer that relays the camera & positioning data to the operator. The robots have depth, cruise, and hull-hold control capabilities which simplify the teleoperation process. This is particularly important in challenging conditions with vortices and reduced depth visibility
